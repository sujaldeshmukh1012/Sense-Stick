The Saturday market was a noise of confusion, a smell-overload that Leo typically indulged in. The scent of freshly baked bread from one stand, the stench of aging cheese at another, the distant concord of a busker's guitar—the terrain he navigated by odor and sound. On this day, though, the throng was thicker, the noises more vague.

His right hand held his faithful white cane, the tip sweeping over the rugged sidewalk. The left hand, however, rested on something else. Under the cane handle, his fingers wrapped around the smooth, tube-like casing of the SENSE Stick. It was an extension of the cane in sensation, its weight indetectable but its presence beautifully comforting.

As he propelled further into the crowd, the handle began a gentle, rhythmic throb—thump. thump. thump. It was the low-level proximity warning. The ultrasonic sensor, the device's invisible eye, was warning him that the path forward was becoming congested. The quiet, low-pitched beep that accompanied it was barely audible to anyone else, a private conversation between himself and his cane.

He narrowed his step, turning left. The pulsing grew faster, the beep rising a little in pitch. Thump-thump-thump. A display stand of a booth, probably with its legs extending too far into the path. He turned again, the fingers of pulsing stopped, and the beeping stopped. He grinned. Before, this would have been a jarring collision of his cane into something. Now it was a smooth, easy passing.

And then, to his right, a clatter of sounds—a shout, a crash, and the frantic flight of individuals retreating. Blind-sided by the blast of sound and the surging river of bodies, Leo lost his balance, his cane ripped from its swooping trajectory. Adrenaline coursed through his veins, a momentary bout of helplessness. His heart surged. This was the exact type of scene that was most lethal.

He didn't panic. His thumb, which was near the controls of the device already, slid sideways and found the large, concave button. The panic button. He squeezed it hard. 

The response was immediate and unmistakable. The vibration motor of the handle gave a deep, continuous hum for three full seconds—a confirmation that his message was sent. He was certain, absolutely certain, that an SOS alert, with his most recent GPS coordinates from the Neo module, was at this very moment hitting the emergency endpoint. His daughter, miles away, would have just been alerted on her phone: "SOS from Leo," preceded by a map of where he stood in the center of the market.

Leo drew a deep breath, composed himself. The hum of reassurance had calmed his nerves. He was still amidst a horde, but no longer isolated. Aid was aware. He reoriented himself, found his bearings, and regained his stride with the cane. The gentle, reassuring thump restarted, his silent friend ready to guide him through the rest of the breathtaking, cacophonous symphony of the marketplace.
