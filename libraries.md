Based on the SENSE Stick code, here are all the libraries used:

## Core Libraries:

### WiFi & HTTP Communication:

- **WiFi.h** - ESP32 WiFi connectivity
- **HTTPClient.h** - HTTP requests to send data to server endpoints

### Data Processing:

- **ArduinoJson.h** - JSON serialization/deserialization for API communication

### Serial Communication:

- **SoftwareSerial.h** - Additional serial ports for GPS and ESP32 communication

### Storage:

- **SD.h** - SD card read/write operations for data storage
- **SPI.h** - SPI communication protocol (required for SD card)

## Library Installation Commands:

For Arduino IDE Library Manager, search and install:

1. **ArduinoJson** by Benoit Blanchon
2. **ESP32** board package (for WiFi.h and HTTPClient.h)
3. **SoftwareSerial** (usually included with Arduino IDE)
4. **SD** (usually included with Arduino IDE)
5. **SPI** (usually included with Arduino IDE)

## Additional Libraries You May Need:

Depending on your specific hardware modules, you might also need:

### For Camera Module:

- **esp_camera.h** - ESP32 camera library (if using ESP32-CAM)

### For GPS Module:

- **TinyGPS++.h** - Enhanced GPS parsing (recommended for better NMEA parsing)
- **SoftwareSerial.h** - Already included

### For Audio Processing:

- **driver/i2s.h** - I2S audio interface (for better audio quality)

### For Advanced Features:

- **EEPROM.h** - Non-volatile storage for settings
- **Wire.h** - I2C communication (if using I2C sensors)

## Installation Notes:

1. **ESP32 Board Package**: Install via Arduino IDE Board Manager

   - Go to File â†’ Preferences
   - Add: `https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json`
   - Install "ESP32 by Espressif Systems"

2. **ArduinoJson**: Install version 6.x for best compatibility

3. **TinyGPS++** (recommended addition): Better GPS parsing than the basic implementation in the code
